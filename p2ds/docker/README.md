P2DS Docker
===========

This file contains instructions on how to use the P2DS docker files.

**NOTE** that it makes no sense to deploy any single component of P2DS on its own; they only make sense when deployed together, and when deployed on different machines.

* [Read](../README.md) what P2DS is all about. Also look at the [installation guide](../docs/installation-guide.md) and [user guide](../docs/user-guide.md).

* Decide on where to run the group manager, and where to run the various peers.

* Map and configure the group manager's configuration files (web.xml, context.xml) according to the [installation guide](../docs/installation-guide.md).

* Map and configure the peers' configuration files (web.xml) according to the [installation guide](../docs/installation-guide.md).

* Finally, run the group manager and peers according to the [user guide](../docs/user-guide.md).
